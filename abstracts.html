                            Digital technologies, particularly those related to Artificial Intelligence, are
                            dramatically transforming our lives. Urban Water Cycle, that covers all the services related
                            to the extraction, supply and sanitation of waters in a city, is also being transformed by
                            the development of AI data sources and knowledge management tools. And this transformation
                            encounters the Fourth-Revolution that is taking place in the water sector at the same time.
                            <br /><br />
                            In the talk, some examples at three levels of complexity (technical, management,
                            socio-political) are presented in the form of references to the work done by the author and
                            collaborators after more than 30 years exploring the possibilities of AI in water. Finally,
                            taking into account that, usually, the state of the art analyses this transformation from
                            predominantly technical and positive perspectives, emphasising the benefits of
                            digitalisation, in the talk some risks of digitalisation in water sector are identified and
                            considered.

                            End-to-end Deep Learning architectures have been successfully applied to solving challenging
                            visual tasks, often surpassing human performance across various domains. These methods
                            continue to improve due to advancements in their design and increased availability of data.
                            
                            In the recycling industry, accurately predicting the properties of materials that affect
                            recyclability is of particular practical interest. This produces insights that can enhance
                            the efficiency of the recycling process and reduce its environmental impact.

                            In this talk we will explore the common challenges, opportunities and future outlook of applying deep
                            learning and other machine learning methods in this domain.

                            Today, there is a general consensus that environmental problems, climate change, loss of
                            species, etc. manifesting themselves in many ways like floods,
                            forest fires, shortage and contamination of water resources, deterioration in food
                            production etc., produce severe and urgent threats that require appropriate
                            interventions locally and globally. Computer Science has developed systems of several kinds
                            that provide support to tackle the problems, for instance remote
                            sensing, geographic information systems, or simulation systems, i.e. to the acquisition,
                            storage and retrieval, and generation of data. They can be supportive,
                            but in a limited way: to become effective, data needs to be interpreted, which requires
                            human expertise, and so does the generation of models for simulation.
                            <br /><br />
                            Knowledge is needed to understand the nature and origin of environmental problems and to
                            determine appropriate plans to mitigate or prevent their negative
                            impact. And AI pursues the goal of acquiring, representing, and generating knowledge to make
                            it available to intelligent problem solvers like diagnostic,
                            planning, and decision support systems. So, can AI make a contribution to solving the
                            pressing problems? What kind of problems? And how?
                            <br /><br />
                            In the presentation, we discuss potential contributions of AI (both symbolic AI, with
                            knowledge representation and automated reasoning, and data-driven,
                            training-based techniques) to the acquisition, representation, and exploitation of knowledge
                            and discovery of new insights, thus, producing a better understanding
                            of the problems and improvement of intervention planning. We attempt to identify the major
                            challenges and limitations of these contributions, illustrated by some
                            examples and case studies.
